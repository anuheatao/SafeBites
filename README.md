**Step 3: Open this repo in Xcode**
Just click on the .xcworkspace file. *Note: **don't** click on the .xcodeproj since it does not have the full features*

**Step 4: Connect your phone via USB cable to your laptop**
Remember to press "trust your computer" on your phone. Make sure to set the run device to your phone (underneath the playbutton, click on the small arrow next to it and choose your phone.)

**Step 5: Run**
Press the play button and wait (it may take pretty long). You're done! Enjoy ðŸŽ‰
